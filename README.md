About Page
This page contains information about my education, courses I've taken related to design or programming, and projects I've completed over the past year.
All images in the project section are click-able to see the images change.

Visualizations Page
This page contains a graph on the amount of subway lines in selected cities. You can hover over each bar to see the specific number.
Below is an interactive artwork of a swimming fish. Click on either the 'start' or 'stop' to control the fish's movement, and click on 'change color' to see the fish be drawn again in a different color.

My contact information is at the end of both pages.
